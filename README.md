# Carbon Credit Interoperability Platform

# Overview

The Carbon Credit Interoperability Platform is a decentralized infrastructure for tokenizing, trading, and transferring carbon credits across Avalanche blockchain subnets. Leveraging Avalanche's Interchain Messaging Protocol (ICM) and a suite of purpose-built smart contracts, the platform enhances the scalability and interoperability of carbon credit systems in a multichain ecosystem.

# Project Vision

To facilitate a seamless, transparent, and scalable marketplace for carbon credits by leveraging blockchain interoperability, thereby advancing global sustainability efforts.

# Key Features
1. Carbon Credit Tokenization: Carbon credits are tokenized as ERC20 tokens, enabling standardized trading and tracking.
2. Decentralized Marketplace: A robust platform for listing, buying, and selling carbon credits with dynamic price updates through oracles.
3. Cross-Chain Transfers: Enables users to transfer carbon credits between Avalanche subnets using the Interchain Messaging Protocol (ICM).
4. Oracle Integration: Real-time pricing and market data updates via Avalanche-native ICTT oracles.

# Modular and Scalable Architecture

Built to adapt and scale across additional blockchain environments, ensuring flexibility for future enhancements.

**Smart Contracts**
1. CarbonCredit.sol
- Purpose: Tokenizes carbon credits as ERC20 tokens.
- Features: Minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

2. Marketplace.sol
- Purpose: Decentralized trading marketplace for carbon credits.
- Features:
   - Listing and purchasing carbon credits.
   - Price tracking using an ICTT oracle.

4. ICMHandler.sol
- Purpose: Handles all cross-chain messaging for carbon credit transfers.
- Features:
   - Encoding, relaying, and execution of ICM messages.
   - Minting tokens on target chains after successful cross-chain transfers.

5. PriceOracle.sol
- Purpose: Updates real-time prices of carbon credits using Avalanche-native oracle services.

# How to Use the Platform
1. Tokenize Carbon Credits
- Use the mint function in CarbonCredit.sol to create new carbon credit tokens.
- Burn tokens via the burn function to account for used credits.
2. Trade Carbon Credits
- Sellers list carbon credits for sale via the listCredit function in Marketplace.sol.
- Buyers purchase credits using the buyCredit function.
3. Transfer Credits Cross-Chain
- Initiate a cross-chain transfer using transferCredit in ICMHandler.sol.
- The ICM Router relays messages to mint tokens on the target chain.

# Testing
Run unit tests for all smart contracts:
- npx hardhat test

Verify the following functionalities:

- Carbon credit minting, burning, and transferring.
- Marketplace listing and buying.
- Cross-chain transfer of tokens.

# Future Enhancements
- Multi-Chain Expansion: Integrate with non-Avalanche blockchains using additional cross-chain protocols.
- Reputation System: Implement user reputation tracking for sellers to enhance marketplace reliability.
- Dynamic Pricing Algorithms: Incorporate machine learning for better price forecasting based on market trends.
- Decentralized Governance: Introduce DAO-like mechanisms for carbon credit allocation and policy-making.

# Target Audience
- Environmental organizations and carbon offset providers.
- Businesses seeking transparent carbon credit systems.
- Developers and users in blockchain-based sustainability initiatives.
